The website will have the following specification:

- Show a list of bookmarks
  As a user,
  so I can choose what to read,
  I would like to see a list of what I've bookmarked

| Objects  | Messages |
| -------- | -------- |
| Bookmark | read     |
| List     | display  |

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager

Postgres installation: 

1. brew install postgresql
2. brew services start postgresql
3. psql postgres
4. CREATE DATABASE "bookmark_manager";
5. Connect to the database using \c bookmark_manager;
6. Run query from 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql

CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager_test;
CREATE TABLE bookmarks (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, url VARCHAR(60));
